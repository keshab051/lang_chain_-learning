structured output
 In langchai, structured output refers to the practice of having 
 language models return responses in a well-defined data
 format(for example,JSON),rather than free-form text. this 
 makes the model output easier to parse and work with programmatically.

    '''in this method before invoking the model we have to 
        specify data-format . we can specify data-formate in 3 ways :
        typed dictionary , pydantic , json_schema'''

1.  TypedDict: is a way to define a dictionary in python where you specify what 
    keys and values should exist. it helps ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structure.

    Why use TypedDict?
    • It tells Python what keys are required and what types of values they should have.
    • It does not validate data at runtime (it just helps with type hints for better coding).

2.  pydantic:
