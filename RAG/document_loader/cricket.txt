**Ode to the Pitch**

Under the burning afternoon sun,
Where leather meets the willow’s run,
A hush falls soft on grassy ground—
Then echoes rise with sharp appeal sound.

White lines drawn on emerald field,
A silent promise fate will yield,
Eleven hearts in patient stance,
Await the ball’s uncertain dance.

The bowler marks his measured stride,
With storm and strategy inside,
He lets it fly— a crimson seam,
A flash of hope, a batter’s dream.

The bat comes down in perfect arc,
A thunderclap, a soaring spark,
It splits the sky, it skims the breeze,
It races past the boundary trees.

A fielder dives with outstretched hand,
Like poetry drawn in golden sand,
A single catch, a turning tide,
Where glory walks and doubts must hide.

From dusty streets to stadium light,
From village cheers to roaring night,
Cricket lives in every cheer—
In every loss, in every tear.

For more than runs or trophies bright,
It teaches grace in fiercest fight,
That patience builds, that courage stays,
And hope returns in second days.

So raise the bat, let voices ring,
Let leather strike and bowlers swing,
For in that pitch of earth and sky,
The spirit of a game won’t die. 🏏
